## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Discrete Mathematics at TU Graz, working with Mihyun Kang. 
I did my PhD in Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of Penny Haxell. 

With Joshua Erde and Mihyun Kang, I help organize the [Graz Combinatorics Seminar](https://www.math.tugraz.at/comb/index.php?link=seminars).
My research interests lie in extremal, probabilistic, and topological combinatorics.
In particular, I am interested in transversals, matchings, independent sets, colorings, and connections to combinatorial optimization, algebraic topology, and statistical physics.
